CABOT: Children's Board Processing Machine
-----------------
The goal of this project is developing a new machine for children to make some puzzles from waste paper board all by themselves. 

The project consists of concepts, design, manufacturing, and prototypoing. I'm mainly in charge of the design of CABOT, especially in Solidworks.

My teammates and I considered safety as the prior part of the whole design of CABOT, since children are the users of CABOT. So we designed many mechanisms to prevent our users from touching the blades inside the machine. Also we care about the energy efficiency since cutting the paper board cost much energy while the children don't have much strength.
