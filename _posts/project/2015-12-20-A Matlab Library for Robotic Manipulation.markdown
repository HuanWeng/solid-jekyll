A Matlab Library for Robotic Manipulation
-----------------

In this project, I wrote a Matlab library of functions to implement robotic manipulation.

The concepts or algorithms were learned from Prof. Kevin Lynch's course: Robotic Manipulation. The functions span from basic operations on SO(3) and SE(3) elements, screw axes, matrix exponentials, calculating Jacobians, to more advanced algorithmic procedures like numerical inverse kinematics and dynamics, polynomial time-scaling and optimum joint trajectory generation.

Many of these functions were used to simulate real robots - the UR5 (6DoF) and WAM (7DoF) robotic arms - using their URDF files. The simulations of the robot motions are shown as GIF above and the figures below show the joint movements and the effect of trajectory tracking.
