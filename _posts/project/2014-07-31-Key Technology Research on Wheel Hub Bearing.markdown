Key Technology Research on Wheel Hub Bearing
-----------------
The preloads of wheel hub bearing affects its working performance and service life. In order to study the action mechanism. the study on the effect of wheel hub bearing preloads on the natural frequency is particularly important. Aiming at a certain type wheel hub bearing, the wheel bearing swept sine vibration test system was built. and the conclusion was got after testing different preload of wheel hub bearing. The figure below shows the frequency response of the wheel hub bearing.

As the fiure shown below, the conclusion is that in the experimental condition, when the preload increases, the first order natural frequency of the wheel hub bearing becomes larger as well. But growth trend of the first order natural frequency becomes smaller with the preload increasing.
