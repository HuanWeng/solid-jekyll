Experiments and Analyses of In-hand Sliding Manipulation with Spring-Sliding Compliance
-----------------
This project studies quasistatic in-hand sliding manipulation with spring-sliding compliant grasps. The final goal is to complete some regrasping tasks by sliding and we are preparing a paper for next IROS.

In this project, we use WAM robot, Allegro Hand and a vision system. I built the impedance controller to control fingertip positions of Allegro Hand, especially its springiness. I also programmed some of the controller of WAM robot using C.

We also built the experiment setup and analyzing the result of experiments with a planar case regrasping example. The schematic figure below shows the grasp in the experiment.

I can show more details if I get the permit from my lab.
