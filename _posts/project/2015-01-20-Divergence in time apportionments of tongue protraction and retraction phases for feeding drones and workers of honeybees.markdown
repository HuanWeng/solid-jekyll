Divergence in time apportionments of tongue protraction and retraction phases for feeding drones and workers of honeybees
-----------------
This project focused on the intellectual structural design inspired by the insect bionics, based on principles of feeding behavior of insects.

We observed the movements of in-feeding honeybeesâ€™ tongues, analyzed the motion characteristics of related tiny organs and microstructures of the appendages. 

Then I introduced a physical model to reveal the energy-saving strategies embedded in the nectar-feeding behavior.

Finally I analyzed the functional diversities of feeding behavior among bees of different species and sexes to investigate the evolutionary-related adaptability to environment constraints.

Notice: All the figures show here are from another published paper: "The Morphology and Reciprocation Movement of Honeybee's Hairy Tongue for Nectar Uptake" in Journal of Bionic Engineering (doi:10.1016/S1672-6529(14)60163-3). My paper is submitted to Journal of Morphology and hasn't published yet.
