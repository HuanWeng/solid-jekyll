Upper Limb Robot Exoskeleton
-----------------
This project aimed to develop a robot exoskeleton to provide extra force for workers to lift some heavy things, or to be used in patient rehabilitation.

I Led the group to complete the entire research process. We first made some survey about exoskeletons and anaylzed our problems. Then we designed our robot exoskeleton using Solidworks and Simulation with FEM. Also we chose the motor, MCU, power supply and sensors. We develop the program of controlling all the device and then tested it physically. Finally we made a prototype of upper limb robot exoskeleton.

Some details are shown in the figure slides above.
