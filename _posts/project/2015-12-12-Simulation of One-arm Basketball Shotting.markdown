Simulation of One-arm Basketball Shooting
-----------------
This project is an academic project. The goal is to simulate a complex motion of human or objects using Lagrangian mechanics. 

I analysed the motion of both arm and basketball using geometry and kinematics in Lagrangian mechanics. I simplified the arm as a 2R open chain and assumed that the shooting direction of the basketball can be freely changed without any energy loss. 

Finally I developed Mathematica program to simulate the process of shooting and made the 3D animation.
