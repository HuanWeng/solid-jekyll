            <h4>More About Huan Weng.</h4>
            <p>I'm Huan Weng, originally from China, I'm currently pursuing an MS of Mechanical Engineering in Northwestern University. I'm doing my thesis in Neuroscience and Robotics Lab (NxR) supervised by Prof. Kevin Lynch. I got my Bachelor degree of Mechanical Engineering from Beihang University (BUAA), China.</p>
            <p>As an undergraduate, I decided to undertake a number of different projects encompassing exoskeleton, medical devices and vibration research. I was drawn to robotics because of its interdisciplinary and practical nature. In my graduat program, I learned much more about robotics including theories and applications, both in class and by myself. Although almost every aspect of robotics is so fascinating, I've developed a strong interest in robotic manipulation, human-machine interaction, control and mechatronics.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like thinking, going to see a new movie, hiking, playing some sports, designing and playing my Lego such as creating a simple and strong suspension system for my remote control Porsche model, and plenty of other things depending on who's around and what's happening.</p>
			<p>I am a person who spare no effot to do what I love. I love robotics and willing to learn much more about it. As the time for robot approaches, I hope some day I can change the world using my brain, or at least improve others' lives. There is an old saying in china that: There are men dead before their death, like some others live on after their days. I wish I could live on after my days, in this way. </p>
            <p>I'm presently seeking relevant PhD programs about Robotics. Feel free to contact me if you think I could be a good fit for your lab/project.</p>
