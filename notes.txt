The preloads of wheel hub bearing affects its working performance and service life. In order to study the action mechanism. the study on the effect of wheel hub bearing preloads on the natural frequency is particularly important. Aiming at a certain type wheel hub bearing, the wheel bearing swept sine vibration test system was built. and the conclusion was got after testing different preload of wheel hub bearing. The figure below shows the frequency response of the wheel hub bearing.

As the fiure shown below, the conclusion is that in the experimental condition, when the preload increases, the first order natural frequency of the wheel hub bearing becomes larger as well. But growth trend of the first order natural frequency becomes smaller with the preload increasing. 


In this project, I wrote a Matlab library of functions to implement robotic manipulation.

The concepts or algorithms were learned from Prof. Kevin Lynch's course: Robotic Manipulation. The functions span from basic operations on SO(3) and SE(3) elements, screw axes, matrix exponentials, calculating Jacobians, to more advanced algorithmic procedures like numerical inverse kinematics and dynamics, polynomial time-scaling and optimum joint trajectory generation.

Many of these functions were used to simulate real robots - the UR5 (6DoF) and WAM (7DoF) robotic arms - using their URDF files. The simulations of the robot motions are shown as GIF above and the figures below show the joint movements and the effect of trajectory tracking.
